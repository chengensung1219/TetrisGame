# Overview

I am trying to learn more new programming languages. The reason that I chose to learn Java is that I might have a internship opportunity in the future that they need it. For this goal, I need to learn Java.

This is a game software (Tetris Game). It is like a normal Tetris game, but the scoring system has a little bit different. Also, every 4 times the row got eliminated, the difficult level will be higher, which means that the drop speed will become faster. 

The purpose of writing this software is to help me built somethings that I am interest and enjoy with. So, I will have more motivation to practice and to learn this language.

# Development Environment

The tool that I going to use is IntelliJ IDEA which support Java better. I will also use YouTube and ChatGPT to help me answer and learn those questions that I might not know. And give me the differences between Java with other programming languages.

This is a Java game, so I will be using IntelliJ IDEA with Java on it to develop my software. Also, I will also be using the JFrame to help me with the basic game framework for Tetris game.
